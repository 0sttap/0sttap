**As a Blockchain Developer with over 3 years of experience, I specialize in designing and developing decentralized applications (DApps) across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Layer-2 blockchains, and Solana. I bring deep expertise in smart contract development, leveraging Solidity and Rust to create efficient, scalable, and secure solutions tailored to both EVM and Solana ecosystems.**

**My skill set includes proficiency in low-level programming languages like Yul and Huff for EVM optimization, alongside modern frameworks such as Hardhat, Foundry, and Anchor to streamline development processes. I also incorporate tools like Node.js and Express.js for robust backend development and integrate decentralized indexing solutions like The Graph to enable seamless access to blockchain data.**

**With a strong focus on performance and innovation, I have led the development of blockchain games, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, and fully on-chain solutions, delivering high-quality, production-ready systems that push the boundaries of decentralized technology.**
